# Make TinyML Manageble

The future of machine learning is tiny and bright. More and more TinyML solutions, especially neural networks, are proposed to run on constrained embedded devices, and they can consume sensor data everywhere in real-time.  However, the embedded hardware is typically customized towards specific tasks and is subject to fragmentation. In addition, the deployment of TinyML has the take hardware constraints under consideration, such as available sensors, memory, which makes the management of mass and diverse TinyML system very difficult considering the massive amount of embedded devices shipped every year. In light of these challenges, we present a framework based on semantics to enable easy management of both hardware and neural network models, from discovering the possible microcontrollers and neural networks to deploying TinyML models.

## Documentation
* [collected_models](): the TinyML models (tflite) that we collected
* [estimate_tensor_arena_size](): the source file to estimate the RAM consumption given a tflite model based on the work of [edgeimpulse](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/tflite-find-arena-size)
* [model_repo](): a folder to stimulate a model repo for hosting the parsed tflite models
* [semantic_schema](): the RDF schema / information model we proposed for TinyML neural network and embedded devices, as well as the schema for the demo
* [Demo_Arduino_Motion](): the Arduino implementation of deploying TinyML models on a Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board using BLE on the fly.
* bin2tflite.py: convert binary tinyml model to tflite format
* find-arena-size: the binary executable to calculate RAM consumption given a tflite model
* Models_Information.xlsx: a excel sheet storing the information of collected tflite models for easier parsing
* rdflib_push.py: push the semantic representation of TinyML system (NN models or devices) to the knowledge graph hosted in GraphDB
* rdflib_read_ttl.py: pretty print a serialized RDF turtle file
* requirements.txt: use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages
* semantic_querying.py: use SPARQL to query the knowledge graph hosted in GraphDB
* semantic_utils.py
* sparql_queries.py: a few example sparql queries
* tflite2semantic_parser_xlsx.py: generate semantic representations of the NN models stored in the folder [collected_models]() based on the information provided in `Models_Information.xlsx`
* tflite2semantic_user_input.py: generate a semantic representation for each NN model by asking the user a few questions

## Use

Our project is runnable in a Linux environment, as the binary executable is built on a Linux environment. Alternatively, one can use our [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) script to start the development.

Install the project:

```
git clone 'to be added'
```

Install the dependency:
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Run  `tflite2semantic_parser_xlsx.py` to see how the stored models can be parsed into semantic representation against the information stored in the folder `Models_Information.xlsx` in one go. Please be aware that the order of the models listed in the the folder `collected_models`  and in the information sheet `Models_Information.xlsx` should both be in alphabetic order and match with each other.

Run  `tflite2semantic_user_input.py` to see how each stored model can be parsed into semantic representation by answering a few questions in the CMD.

To store the semantic representations of neural networks and embedded devices, we recommend using [GraphDB free](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/). The scripts `rdflib_push.py`, `semantic_querying.py`, `sparql_queries.py` contain the code and example queries for interacting with GraphDB.

To deploy the tflite model from a central device to an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board using BLE and thus change the model on the board without reflashing the code, please see the instructions in  [Demo_Arduino_Motion]()
